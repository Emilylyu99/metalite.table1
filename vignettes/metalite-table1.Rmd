# Motivation 

A table for descriptive statistics is widely used 
in medical research and typically be the first table (i.e. `table1`) 
for a manuscript. 

There are R packages and examples to create the table1: 

- [`table1`](https://github.com/benjaminrich/table1)

For use case in clinical trials, 
[Chapter 4 of the R for clinical study reports and submission](https://r4csr.org/baseline-characteristics.html) 
contains more details. 

The `metalite.table1` provide an interactive table1 to 
enhance the communication between statisticians and clinicians. 

```{r}
# Prepare analysis ready data
df <- r2rtf_adsl
df$AGE[1:3] <- NA # Create missing value for illustration purpose.
df$ARM <- factor(
  df$ARM,
  c("Placebo", "Xanomeline Low Dose", "Xanomeline High Dose"),
  c("Placebo", "Low Dose", "High Dose")
)

df[1:6, c("USUBJID", "ARM", "AGE", "SEX", "RACE", "BMIBLGR1")]
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Create interactive table1
metalite_table1(~ AGE + SEX + RACE + BMIBLGR1 | ARM, # formula for analysis variables and group
  data = df, # source data
  id = "USUBJID"
) # unique subject id
```

The interactive features are illustrated in the GIF below. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/table1.gif")
```

In comparison with the `table1` R package, 
we are able to answer ad-hoc questions from clinicians with interactive features such as 

- Who are those subjects with missing value. 
- Who are those outliers.  
- What's the distribution of a variable by treatment group. 

Those are common questions for ongoing clinical trials. 

```{r, eval}
# create table1
table1(~ AGE + SEX + RACE + BMIBLGR1 | ARM, data = df)
```
